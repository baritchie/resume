My name is Benjamin Ritchie, and I am a Computer Science student at Humboldt State University. I have a background mostly in WordPress and Jekyll/Liquid development. Currently, I am still learning SEO strategy and solidifying my understanding of JavaScript with more formal training. While I'm not an expert in anything, I try to learn as much as I can. 

I hope you can find some useful information on here. There's some weird things I've come across that I want to document a little bit, and just writing a little bit about WordPress and Jekyll and how we can all find harmony is important to me.
